# **Python Revision Guide: Multithreading & Multiprocessing ðŸš€**

Parallel execution is essential for optimizing performance in Python.

âœ… **Multithreading** â†’ Best for I/O-bound tasks

âœ… **Multiprocessing** â†’ Best for CPU-bound tasks

---

## **1. Multithreading (`threading` module)**

Multithreading allows multiple threads to run concurrently within the same process.

ðŸ”¹ **Best for I/O-bound tasks** (e.g., file I/O, network requests, database queries)

ðŸ”¹ **Uses same memory space** but requires synchronization

---

### **1.1 Creating Threads in Python**

```python
import threading

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(1, 6):
        print(f"Thread {threading.current_thread().name}: {i}")

# Creating threads
t1 = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers, name="T1")
t2 = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers, name="T2")

t1.start()
t2.start()

t1.join()
t2.join()
```

ðŸ”¹ **Thread Execution Flow**

```
Thread T1: 1
Thread T2: 1
Thread T1: 2
Thread T2: 2
...
```

---

### **1.2 Thread Synchronization using Locks**

Threads may **modify shared resources** unpredictably. Use `Lock` to prevent race conditions.

```python
import threading
import time

lock = threading.Lock()
counter = 0

def safe_increment():
    global counter
    with lock:  # Lock ensures only one thread modifies counter at a time
        local_copy = counter
        time.sleep(0.1)
        local_copy += 1
        counter = local_copy

threads = [threading.Thread(target=safe_increment) for _ in range(5)]

for t in threads:
    t.start()

for t in threads:
    t.join()

print(f"Final Counter Value: {counter}")  # Always 5
```

ðŸ”¹ **Diagram (Thread Locking)**

```
Thread-1    LOCK      Modify counter
Thread-2    WAIT
Thread-3    WAIT
...
```

---

### **1.3 Thread Pool (Efficient Multi-Threading)**

For better thread management, use `ThreadPoolExecutor` from `concurrent.futures`.

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def square(n):
    return n * n

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:
    results = executor.map(square, numbers)

print(list(results))  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

ðŸ”¹ **Thread Pool automatically manages threads**

ðŸ”¹ **Efficient for many short tasks**

---

## **2. Multiprocessing (`multiprocessing` module)**

ðŸ”¹ **Best for CPU-bound tasks** (e.g., image processing, machine learning)

ðŸ”¹ **Each process has separate memory** (no race conditions)

---

### **2.1 Creating Processes in Python**

```python
import multiprocessing

def square(n):
    print(f"Process {multiprocessing.current_process().name}: {n * n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    processes = [multiprocessing.Process(target=square, args=(i,), name=f"P{i}") for i in range(1, 6)]

    for p in processes:
        p.start()

    for p in processes:
        p.join()
```

ðŸ”¹ **Diagram (Process Execution)**

```
Process P1: 1
Process P2: 4
Process P3: 9
...
```

---

### **2.2 Shared Memory (Avoiding Global Variables)**

ðŸ”¹ Since each process has  **its own memory** , shared memory is needed for inter-process communication.

```python
import multiprocessing

def increment(shared_value):
    shared_value.value += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    shared_value = multiprocessing.Value("i", 5)  # Shared integer

    processes = [multiprocessing.Process(target=increment, args=(shared_value,)) for _ in range(3)]

    for p in processes:
        p.start()

    for p in processes:
        p.join()

    print(f"Final Shared Value: {shared_value.value}")  # 8
```

---

### **2.3 Process Pool (Efficient Multi-Processing)**

```python
from multiprocessing import Pool

def square(n):
    return n * n

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with Pool(4) as pool:  # 4 processes
        results = pool.map(square, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    print(results)  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

ðŸ”¹ **Process Pool handles multiple CPU-intensive tasks automatically**

---

## **3. Multithreading vs Multiprocessing (Comparison Table)**

| Feature         | Multithreading (`threading`) | Multiprocessing (`multiprocessing`) |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Best For        | I/O-bound tasks                | CPU-bound tasks                       |
| Memory          | Shared memory                  | Separate memory                       |
| Execution       | Single core (GIL limitation)   | Multiple cores                        |
| Speed           | Faster for I/O                 | Faster for CPU tasks                  |
| Race Conditions | Possible (use `Lock`)        | No race conditions                    |

## **ðŸ“Œ Summary**

âœ… **Multithreading** â†’ Best for I/O-bound tasks, uses `threading.Thread()`

âœ… **Multiprocessing** â†’ Best for CPU-bound tasks, uses `multiprocessing.Process()`

âœ… **Synchronization** â†’ Use `Lock` to prevent race conditions

âœ… **ThreadPoolExecutor & Pool** â†’ Efficient management of threads/processes
