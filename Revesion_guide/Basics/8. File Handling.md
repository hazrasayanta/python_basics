# **Python Revision Guide: File Handling ðŸ“‚**

File handling allows Python programs to **read, write, and manipulate files** on a system.

âœ… **Modes:** `"r"`, `"w"`, `"a"`, `"rb"`, `"wb"`, etc.

âœ… **Operations:** Read, Write, Append, Delete, Rename

---

## **1. File Handling Modes**

| Mode     | Description                                       |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `"r"`  | Read mode (default, error if file does not exist) |
| `"w"`  | Write mode (overwrites if file exists)            |
| `"a"`  | Append mode (adds content at the end)             |
| `"r+"` | Read & Write (file must exist)                    |
| `"w+"` | Read & Write (overwrites file)                    |
| `"a+"` | Read & Append (creates file if missing)           |
| `"rb"` | Read in binary mode                               |
| `"wb"` | Write in binary mode                              |

## **2. Opening & Closing a File**

```python
file = open("example.txt", "w")  # Open file in write mode
file.write("Hello, Python!\n")   # Write data
file.close()                     # Close file
```

âœ… Always **close** a file after use to free system resources.

---

## **3. Reading a File**

### **3.1 Read Entire File**

```python
file = open("example.txt", "r")
content = file.read()
print(content)
file.close()
```

### **3.2 Read Line-by-Line**

```python
file = open("example.txt", "r")
for line in file:
    print(line.strip())  # Removes trailing newline
file.close()
```

### **3.3 Read Only First Few Characters**

```python
file = open("example.txt", "r")
print(file.read(5))  # Reads first 5 characters
file.close()
```

---

## **4. Writing to a File**

```python
file = open("example.txt", "w")  # Overwrites file
file.write("Python is fun!\n")
file.write("File handling is easy!\n")
file.close()
```

ðŸ”¹ **Existing content is erased in `"w"` mode**

---

## **5. Appending to a File**

```python
file = open("example.txt", "a")
file.write("Appending this line.\n")
file.close()
```

ðŸ”¹ **Adds content at the end without erasing previous data**

---

## **6. Using `with` Statement (Best Practice)**

```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)  # No need to manually close the file
```

âœ… **Automatically closes the file after execution**

---

## **7. Working with Binary Files**

```python
with open("image.jpg", "rb") as file:
    binary_data = file.read()
```

âœ… Use `"rb"` for reading images, PDFs, and other non-text files.

---

## **8. File Handling with `os` Module**

```python
import os

# Check if a file exists
if os.path.exists("example.txt"):
    os.remove("example.txt")  # Delete file
else:
    print("File does not exist.")
```

---

## **9. Renaming & Deleting Files**

```python
import os

# Rename file
os.rename("example.txt", "new_example.txt")

# Remove file
os.remove("new_example.txt")
```

ðŸ”¹ **Ensure the file exists before renaming or deleting.**

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Summary**

âœ… **Open & Close Files Properly**

âœ… **Use `"r"`, `"w"`, `"a"` Modes for Reading, Writing, Appending**

âœ… **Use `with open()` for automatic file handling**

âœ… **Use `os` module for file operations (delete, rename, check existence)**
